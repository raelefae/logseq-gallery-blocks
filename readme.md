This is a fork of CorrectRoadH's Logseq Gallery plugin. This gallery plugin works in tandem with the Banners Logseq plugin to make a gallery view of pages using their banners as images.

I'm hoping to achieve something similar, but displaying blocks instead of pages.

Currently a work-in-progress.

This is my first time working with typescript and am honestly a bit in over my head. :)


Below is the original readme:
